                                <img src="images/race_winner.jpg" alt="" class="marathon-pic"/>
                                <p>Estes Park native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field of the best
                                    long-distance runners in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off
                                    the women's course record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson finished
                                    second and third, respectively. Laura's victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA
                                    Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado State.</p>
                                <p>In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's
                                    marathon for the second straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the
                                    race, Kyle Wills of Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not match Teagan's finishing
                                    pace. Jason Wu of Boulder, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.</p>
                                <p>This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's history, with
                                    over 9500 men and 6700 women competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and
                                    temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees.</p>

                                <img src="images/highway_seven.jpg" alt="" class="highway-pic"/>
                                <p>Highway 7 will reopen this Friday, June 3rd, after a final safety inspection. A late blizzard delayed
                                    road crews, marking this as one of the latest dates on record for the highway's reopening.
                                </p>
                                <p>Rising to an elevation of over 12,000 feet, Highway 7 is a main link between Estes Park and Grand
                                    Lake. The reopening of the road is one of the annual signs that summer is near and the tourist
                                    season will soon be upon us!
                                </p>

                                <h1>Cougar Sightings Increase </h1>
                                <img src="images/cougar_siting.png" alt="" class="cougar-pic"/>
                                <p>Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Este Park area according to a report released
                                    yesterday by the state DNR. In the last month alone, there were ten sightings in Estes Park and
                                    the surrounding communities of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to only twelve
                                    sightings for the entire spring of last year.
                                </p>
                                <p>Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include increasing encroachment by people into
                                    former wildlife habitats and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk
                                    and deer being taken by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into developed areas, following the
                                    herds.
                                </p>
                                <p>DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report line at 555-6981 if they believe
                                    they have seen a cougar or any large predatory animal. Two fatalities have already occurred in
                                    the west this year from cougar attacks.
                                </p>
